#Introduction to Using R
R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language that allows you to process and analyze lots of data and to organize it and process it efficiently and to generate beautiful publication ready figures.  The best part of all this is that it is free and all the work that you do will theoretically be 100% reproducible.
&nbsp;
```{r  load_packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
```



#Importing your data
This section will demonstrate how to get started with analyzing data using R.

**You will first want to tell R where to find all of your files, you can do this with the "setwd" command**  
- This is where R will read in all of your files and output your data that you generate(plots, CSVs, etc)  

**You can abbreviate long filenames by calling it an object, in this case we can make our long csv = "my data"**  
- This way you can just use "mydata" and it will automatically insert the filename  

**Next we will want to import the csv into r and we can accomplish this with the "read_csv" function**  
- This will import our csv file and we can make this an object known as "data"  
- Anytime we want to see the dataframe we can simply run "data"

```{r}
setwd("~/NanoVideos/2017-02-07/")

mydata <- "virgin_combined-ExperimentSummary.csv"

data <- read_csv(mydata)

```

&nbsp;
We can quickly look at the dimensions of the dataframe with **dim()**
&nbsp;
```{r}
dim(data)
```

&nbsp;
We can see the top of the dataframe with **head()**
&nbsp;
```{r}
head(data)
```

&nbsp;
You can also look at the bottom with **tail()**
&nbsp;

```{r}
tail(data)
```

#Convert data from wide type to long
```{r}
data1 <- data %>%
  gather(Sample,Count,2:10 )
data1
```

#Separate samples by identifiers 

```{r}
data2 <- data1 %>% 
  separate(Sample, into=c("Sample_type","Dilution_factor","Injection","Tech_rep", sep = "_")) %>% 
  select(-`_`)
data2
```

#Data types
R works with a variety of different data structures including, strings, vectors, factors, lists, integers, numerics and characters.   
What I found that works for me is to think of factors and categorical variables.

We can inspect the structure of the data type
```{r}
str(data2)
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#Fixing data types
We can fix the data types to make things a factor (typically categorical variables) or numeric for numbers
The typical way to reformat data types is to call the data and specify the column name using **dataframe_name$column_name**  
Next you need to assign the column name **as.factor()** or **as.numeric()**, be sure to make sure the column is specified  
Then you will want to make **as.factor()** or **as.numeric()** equal to the column that you are changing 
&nbsp;
```{r}
data2$Sample_type <- as.factor(data2$Sample_type)
data2$Dilution_factor <- as.numeric(data2$Dilution_factor)
data2$Injection<- as.factor(data2$Injection)
data2$Tech_rep <- as.numeric(data2$Tech_rep)
```
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Afterwards, be sure to check the data structure to make sure you did things correctly using the **str()**
```{r}
str(data2)
```
&nbsp;
We can use **group_by()** to effectively 'lock' in certain variables/factors within a particular column.  In our case we will use group_by to 'lock' the particle_size, dilution factor and injection columns.  
&nbsp;
Next we can use  **summarise()** to calculate the  number of rows within a certain group, calculate the average, standard deviation and standard error of the mean.
&nbsp;
```{r}
data3 <- data2 %>% 
  group_by(particle_size,Sample_type,Dilution_factor,Injection) %>% 
  summarise( tech_N = length(Count),
             tech_mean = mean(Count),
             tech_sd = sd(Count),
             tech_se = tech_sd/sqrt(tech_N))
data3
```
&nbsp;  
We can repeat **summarise()** again but on data3  to summarize the three readings to get one central reading  
We can make this new summarization = data4
&nbsp;
```{r}
data4 <- data3 %>% 
  group_by(particle_size,Sample_type,Dilution_factor) %>% 
  summarise( inj_N = length(tech_mean),
             inj_mean = mean(tech_mean),
             inj_sd = sd(tech_mean),
             inj_se = inj_sd/sqrt(inj_N))
data4
```
&nbsp;
#Graphing data
Now that the data is structured properly we can graph the data to get an idea of what is going on.  
We will use the **ggplot()**
&nbsp;  
```{r warning=FALSE}
graph1 <- data3 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=particle_size, y=tech_mean,color=Injection ))+ #plot
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=tech_mean-tech_se, ymax=tech_mean+tech_se),alpha=0.2,fill = alpha('grey12', 0.2)) + #error bars
  geom_line(size=2.0) + xlim(0,500)+ #line size, x-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0))+ #set bottom of graph
  xlab("Particle Size") + # X axis label
  ylab("\nMean Particle Concentration/ml\n") + # Y axis label
  ggtitle("Nanosight Histogram of\nVirgin Mouse Plasma")+ #title
  labs(color="Injection")+ #Label table title
  facet_grid(. ~ Injection)
graph1
```

&nbsp;
Next we can graph **data4** 
&nbsp; 

```{r warning=FALSE}
graph2 <- data4 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=particle_size, y=inj_mean,color=Sample_type ))+ #plot
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=inj_mean-inj_se, ymax=inj_mean+inj_se),alpha=0.2,fill = alpha('grey12', 0.2)) + #error bars
  geom_line(size=2) + xlim(0,500)+ #line size, x-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0))+ #set bottom of graph
  xlab("Particle Size") + # X axis label
  ylab("\nMean Particle Concentration/ml\n") + # Y axis label
  ggtitle("Nanosight Histogram of\nVirgin Mouse Plasma")+ #title
  labs(color="Condition") #Label table title
graph2

```

&nbsp;
Next we can create a publication Quality figure by combining both graph1 and graph2 using the  **plot_grid()** function from the cowplot library.
&nbsp; 

```{r warning=FALSE}
plot_grid(graph1,graph2, labels = c("Individual\nInjections","Averaged"),nrow = 2, align = "v")
```
